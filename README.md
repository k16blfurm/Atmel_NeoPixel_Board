# Atmel_NeoPixel_Board

This is a first attempt at a Atmega328-AU board design. This board was designed in KiCad and I've given both schematics/layout. Here are some pictures. I've also added a usb mini b and 16 "NeoPixel" Leds in a string controlled by a singular pin. This was done in a day and I've followed EMC guidlines very loosely. I wouldn't base your design off of this lol.
